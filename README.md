The interaction of transcription factor (TF) proteins with DNA at promoter and enhancer region of the genome play major role in the transcriptional gene regulation.  The sequence-specific interaction of TF protein with DNA modulates the gene expression in such a way that controls cell growth and differentiation. For example, in immunology, the differentiation of naive T cell into different lineage specific effector and memory cells is controlled by the interaction of the T cell linage specific TF proteins with its promoter and enhancer regions of the lineage specific genes.  Therefore, the study of the binding site of the TF protein to certain biomarkers reveal the underling gene regulation in the differentiation and development of T cells.
